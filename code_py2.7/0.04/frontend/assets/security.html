<h2>  Intentions  </h2>
<p>Networking and Cybersecurity became an interest of mine a few years ago. This project represents</p>
<p>an interesting opportunity for me to get some first hand knowledge with the inner workings of the</p>
<p>how the internet works, and how some essential protocols operate. One of the first things I quickly</p>
<p>learned was that there is a continuous influx of requests attempting to take control of your machine.</p>
<p>They literally come from across the world, likely machines taken over by a worm or virus and either</p>
<p>forgotten, abandoned, unknowingly infected... Regardless there is a distinct background radiation that</p>
<p>is simply a fact, and must be accounted for. This machine gets an average of around 2k login attempts a day.</p>

<p>This generally means it's better for everyone if worms do not spread, and users are more informed about</p>
<p>security threats. </p>
