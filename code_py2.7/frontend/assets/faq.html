    <h4> <i>  What is Lynx  </i> </h4>
    <p>
        Lynx is a project that utilizes what is called "peer to peer" technology to make it
        possible to share files, send messages and distribute/retrieve resources in an organic
        network of users. Many popular companies use this technology, though it is often put in
        more abstract terms like "the cloud". Really what is going on here is an attempt to leverage
        the growing inter-connectivity (internet) and memory of available machines to make end users
        benefit from their collective power (be it storage, routing, indexing, etc.) to do pretty
        crazy things. <i> Think BitTorrent, Skype, TOR...</i>
